chayns with React + ES2015 - Template
===================
This template will help you getting started with building Tapps for your chayns®-Website with React and ES2015. First of all you have to make sure, that you have the latest version of [node.js][1] installed.

Setup
-------------
Install all project dependencies:
```
npm i
```
Build the empty folder structure of your project:
```
npm run setup
```
Start your webpack-dev-server for debugging your project:
```
npm start
```
Now you just need to create a Tapp with the URL `http://localhost:8080` and you can debug the project in the chayns environment of your website.
